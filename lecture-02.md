Machine Learning in the News
----------------------------
 
Find a story about machine learning in the popular press (broadly
construed, to include blogs or whatever) and write a summary of the
story, from a technical perspective, about 1/2 page in
length. Information to include would be things like what the problem
they're trying to solve is, how they addressed it, where they got
their data, how much data they had, and what it looked like, why they
considered the problem interesting, etc. Turn it in as a plain text
(or simple markdown format) file. No figures or diagrams or
equations---we'll be doing machine learning with these as a dataset at
that would complicate our lives. Also, be sure to do a spelling
correction, because misspellings will make our lives more difficult
later. Do not include your name in the file; I can get that from
moodle, and it would be a hassle to strip names off. Remember that
other students will be marking these (in addition to myself) so please
try to give them something interesting to read; something you'd enjoy
reading yourself.

(I will process them before class Tuesday, so please have them all in
by 2pm Monday because it is a hassle to slip late ones into the
processing pipeline.)
